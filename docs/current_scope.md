## User Flows

### Registration
- Input validation, rate limiting, and secure password storage
- Default role assignment and event publishing

### Login with MFA
- Primary credential check, MFA prompt, and verification
- JWT token issuance, session tracking, and audit logging

### MFA Setup
- TOTP secret generation, QR code, verification, and backup codes
- Event logging for all MFA actions

### Password Reset
- Secure token generation, email delivery, and password update
- Rate limiting and audit logging

### GDPR Data Export & Deletion
- Authenticated export, deletion request with grace period, anonymization
- Full audit trail for compliance

### Session Management
- List, revoke, and manage sessions across devices
- Device/IP tracking and session timeout

## API Endpoints (Key)
- `/api/auth/register` — User registration
- `/api/auth/login` — Email/password authentication
- `/api/auth/oauth/{provider}` — OAuth authentication
- `/api/auth/refresh-token` — Refresh access token
- `/api/auth/logout` — Logout and invalidate tokens
- `/api/auth/sessions` — List active sessions
- `/api/auth/sessions/{sessionId}` — Revoke session
- `/api/auth/mfa/setup` — Initialize MFA
- `/api/auth/mfa/verify` — Verify MFA
- `/api/auth/password/request-reset` — Request password reset
- `/api/auth/gdpr/export` — Export user data
- `/api/auth/gdpr/request-deletion` — Request account deletion
- `/api/auth/admin/security-report` — Security audit report
- `/api/auth/health` — Service health check

## Security & Compliance
- All sensitive data encrypted at rest
- MFA and GDPR features fully enforced and auditable
- Rate limiting and input validation on all endpoints
- Security audit logs and suspicious activity detection
- RBAC and IP whitelisting for admin endpoints

## Monitoring & Observability
- Metrics: authentication success/failure, MFA adoption, session analytics
- Alerts: failed login spikes, suspicious activity, system health
- Health checks and actuator endpoints for system monitoring

## Test Coverage
- 95%+ unit test coverage for core logic
- Integration, security, and performance tests for all flows
- Automated test execution in CI/CD pipeline

## Limitations Addressed
- All previously identified gaps (MFA, OAuth, GDPR, session management, security logging) are now fully implemented and tested.
